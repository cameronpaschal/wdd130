        <p>Hi my name is Cameron Paschal. I am currently a student at BYUI and I am majoring in Computer Science! I love to rock climb, mountain bike and just enjoy the great outdoors!</p>
        <p>I am super excited for this course and I think it will be really helpful when it comes to web design, especially for a future in business so that I could potentially create my own business and website someday.</p>
        <p>I have been a member of the church my whole life and I just recently returned from my mission in Atlanta GA.</p>

        <p>I like computers and technology and can't wait to learn more about designing webpages!</p>
